##  Django React To-Do App
##  This is a To-Do application built using Django and React. It allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks in a simple and intuitive interface.

##  Features
##  User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and securely authenticate themselves to access the application.

##  Task Management: Users can create new tasks, mark tasks as complete, edit task details, and delete tasks.

##  Task Categories: Tasks can be categorized into different categories or projects to help users organize their to-do lists effectively.

##  Task Filtering and Sorting: Users can filter and sort tasks based on various criteria such as due date, priority, and category.

##  Real-time Updates: The application provides real-time updates, ensuring that changes made by one user are immediately reflected for other users who are viewing the same task.

##  Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive and compatible with different screen sizes and devices, allowing users to manage their tasks on desktop and mobile devices.

##  Technologies Used
Django: The backend of the application is built using the Django framework, which provides a robust and scalable foundation for handling user authentication, data storage, and server-side logic.

##  React: The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for a dynamic and interactive user experience, with components that update efficiently as tasks are added or modified.

##  Django REST Framework: The Django REST Framework is used to create a RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend of the application. It enables seamless integration between Django and React, allowing data to be exchanged in a structured and efficient manner.

##  PostgreSQL: The application uses PostgreSQL as the database management system to store user accounts, tasks, and other relevant data.

##  Webpack: Webpack is used as the module bundler to compile and bundle the frontend assets, including JavaScript, CSS, and images, for efficient delivery to the client's browser.
